First release for Drupal 7

Items that require LDAP (Add UCI User, Batch Add UCI Users) are not
enabled if the LDAP libraries are not available.

Visitor account registration policy, and email validation policy can be
configured separately for UCInetID users.

When administrators create accounts with the "Batch Add UCI Users"
feature, the accounts are always marked as activated (bypassing email
validation requirements) and no email notification is sent.

Previously, upon login into a Drupal account, if the user had recently
authenticated with a UCInetID and the Drupal username matched the
UCInetID, there was an attempt to automatically attach the UCInetID to
the user account.   This created problems in some cases; the user must
now attach the UCInetID manually on the "My Account" page.
